FILE HANDLING IN PYTHON IS THE ABILITY TO PERFORM VARIOUS OPERATIONS ON FILES, LIKE READING FROM AND WRITING TO THEM. FILES ARE USED TO STORE DATA PERMANENTLY (LIKE TEXT DOCUMENTS, IMAGES, OR SPREADSHEETS). UNLIKE VARIABLES, WHICH LOSE THEIR VALUES WHEN A PROGRAM ENDS, FILES PROVIDE PERSISTENT STORAGE.
